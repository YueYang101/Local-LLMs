# Local-LLMs
## workflow
This application allows the user to choose to use either local LLMs or the APIs of LLMs. 
<br>
With the pre-input prompts. The LLM is told the available local functions and their descriptions. With the user-input prompts, the LLM can choose the functions which can meet the demands of the user.
<br>
For now, after the LLM know which functions will be used, it will reply with the trigger word to trigger the corresponding functions (this is what LLM_decision function does).
